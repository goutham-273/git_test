            IPL 2025 started with RCB vs KKR on <strong>22nd march</strong> and RCB started with a bang win. The expected top teams before IPL started are SRH, RCB, MI, Punjab 
            but however SRH and MI had continued losses in the initial phase but MI did a <strong><em>great comeback with continuous wins</em></strong> and made it to playoffs and Punjab
            being at top of the table and played Q1 with RCB and lost.
        </p>

            MI has won the eliminator against GT but lost in Q2 against punjab. Now the big day arrived and its <strong>Punjab vs RCB in the final</strong> and really excited
